## What is it?
Lyrics Crawler is a full-stack web application. It can sync showing lyrics while playing music on Spotify. If users are Spotify premium, it can also be used as a web player and streaming the content between different devices. This project is developed by React (frontend) and NodeJS ([backend](https://github.com/RuoyanMeng/lyrics_crawler_server)), data is provided by Spotify API and Genius API. More data sources will be added in the future to improve user experience.
